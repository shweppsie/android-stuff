nandroidbackup 2.0 - 20081209

  * Switched to using dump_image for dumping boot
    and recovery partitions for ECC checking support.
    dump_image is a modification of flash_image that
    reads NAND and writes to file. 
    Coded by brainaid.

  * Due to inability to read 16 byte extradata
    for yaffs2 partitions I'm switching to a
    tar+mkyaffs2 based method.  NAND imaging method will 
    be pursued after attaining more info and better tools.

  * Tar executed on phone via busybox and piped via busybox nc
    to a forwarded port. Using netcat on host side to dump data 
    to local tar file. 

  * Took mkyaffs2image code from android tree to ensure 
    that the correct method is used to generate images from
    extracted tar. Due to file and user permissions, this 
    requires root; when the user is not root, example 
    commandlines are printed.
